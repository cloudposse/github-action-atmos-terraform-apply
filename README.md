## Introduction

This Github Action is used to run Terraform apply for a single, Atmos-supported component with a saved planfile in S3 and DynamoDB.

Before running this action, first create and store a planfile with the companion action, [github-action-atmos-terraform-plan](https://github.com/cloudposse/github-action-atmos-terraform-plan).



## Usage



### Prerequisites

This GitHub Action requires AWS access for two different purposes. This action will attempt to first pull a Terraform planfile from a S3 Bucket with metadata in a DynamoDB table with one role. 
Then the action will run `terraform apply` against that component with another role. We recommend configuring 
[OpenID Connect with AWS](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-amazon-web-services) 
to allow GitHub to assume roles in AWS and then deploying both a Terraform Apply role and a Terraform State role. 
For Cloud Posse documentation on setting up GitHub OIDC, see our [`github-oidc-provider` component](https://docs.cloudposse.com/components/library/aws/github-oidc-provider/).

In order to retrieve Terraform Plan Files (not to be confused with Terraform State files, e.g. `tfstate`), we configure an S3 Bucket to store plan files and a DynamoDB table to track plan metadata. Both need to be deployed before running
this action. For more on setting up those components, see the [`gitops` component](https://docs.cloudposse.com/components/library/aws/gitops/). This action will then use the [github-action-terraform-plan-storage](https://github.com/cloudposse/github-action-terraform-plan-storage) action to update these resources.

### Config

The action expects the atmos gitops configuration file to be present in the repository in `./.github/config/atmos-gitops.yaml`.
The config should have the following structure:

```yaml
  atmos-version: 1.45.3
  atmos-config-path: ./rootfs/usr/local/etc/atmos/
  terraform-state-bucket: cptest-core-ue2-auto-gitops
  terraform-state-table: cptest-core-ue2-auto-gitops
  terraform-state-role: arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxxxxx:role/cptest-core-ue2-auto-gitops-gha
  terraform-plan-role: arn:aws:iam::yyyyyyyyyyyy:role/cptest-core-gbl-identity-gitops
  terraform-apply-role: arn:aws:iam::yyyyyyyyyyyy:role/cptest-core-gbl-identity-gitops
  terraform-version: 1.5.2
  aws-region: us-east-2
  enable-infracost: false
  sort-by: .stack_slug
  group-by: .stack_slug | split("-") | [.[0], .[2]] | join("-")  
```

### Workflow example

```yaml
  name: "atmos-terraform-apply"

  on:
    workflow_dispatch:
    pull_request:
      types:
        - closed
      branches:
        - main

  # These permissions are required for GitHub to assume roles in AWS
  permissions:
    id-token: write
    contents: read

  jobs:
    plan:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Terraform Apply
          uses: cloudposse/github-action-atmos-terraform-apply@v2
          with:
            component: "foobar"
            stack: "plat-ue2-sandbox"
```

### Migrating from `v1` to `v2`

1.   `v2` drops the `component-path` variable and instead fetches if directly from the [`atmos.yaml` file](https://atmos.tools/cli/configuration/) automatically. Simply remove the `component-path` argument from your invocations of the `cloudposse/github-action-atmos-terraform-apply` action.
2.  `v2` moves most of the `inputs` to the Atmos GitOps config path `./.github/config/atmos-gitops.yaml`. Simply create this file, transfer your settings to it, then remove the corresponding arguments from your invocations of the `cloudposse/github-action-atmos-terraform-apply` action.
|         name             |
|--------------------------|
| `atmos-version`          |
| `atmos-config-path`      |
| `terraform-state-bucket` |
| `terraform-state-table`  |
| `terraform-state-role`   |
| `terraform-plan-role`    |
| `terraform-apply-role`   |
| `terraform-version`      |
| `aws-region`             |
| `enable-infracost`       |


If you want the same behavior in `v2` as in `v1` you should create config `./.github/config/atmos-gitops.yaml` with the same variables as in `v1` inputs.

```yaml
  - name: Terraform apply
    uses: cloudposse/github-action-atmos-terraform-apply@v2
    with:
      atmos-gitops-config-path: ./.github/config/atmos-gitops.yaml
      component: "foobar"
      stack: "plat-ue2-sandbox"
```

Which would produce the same behavior as in `v1`, doing this:

```yaml
  - name: Terraform apply
    uses: cloudposse/github-action-atmos-terraform-apply@v1
    with:
      component: "foobar"
      stack: "plat-ue2-sandbox"
      component-path: "components/terraform/s3-bucket"
      terraform-apply-role: "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/acme-core-gbl-identity-gitops"
      terraform-state-bucket: "acme-core-ue2-auto-gitops"
      terraform-state-role: "arn:aws:iam::999999999999:role/acme-core-ue2-auto-gitops-gha"
      terraform-state-table: "acme-core-ue2-auto-gitops"
      aws-region: "us-east-2"
```

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|---------|----------|
| atmos-gitops-config-path | The path to the atmos-gitops.yaml file | ./.github/config/atmos-gitops.yaml | false |
| branding-logo-image | Branding logo image url | https://cloudposse.com/logo-300x69.svg | false |
| branding-logo-url | Branding logo url | https://cloudposse.com/ | false |
| component | The name of the component to apply. | N/A | true |
| debug | Enable action debug mode. Default: 'false' | false | false |
| infracost-api-key | Infracost API key | N/A | false |
| sha | Commit SHA to apply. Default: github.sha | ${{ github.event.pull\_request.head.sha }} | true |
| stack | The stack name for the given component. | N/A | true |
| token | Used to pull node distributions for Atmos from Cloud Posse's GitHub repository. Since there's a default, this is typically not supplied by the user. When running this action on github.com, the default value is sufficient. When running on GHES, you can pass a personal access token for github.com if you are experiencing rate limiting. | ${{ github.server\_url == 'https://github.com' && github.token \|\| '' }} | false |


## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| status | Apply Status. Either 'succeeded' or 'failed' |
